## reproducible

A set of tools for R that enhance reproducibility beyond package management.
Built on top of `git2r` and `archivist`, this package aims at making high-level, robust, machine and OS independent tools for making deeply reproducible and reusable content in R.
This extends beyond the package management utilites of `packrat` and `checkpoint` by including tools for caching and accessing GitHub repositories.
