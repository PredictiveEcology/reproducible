\title{The \code{reproducible} package}
\description{
Built on top of \pkg{git2r} and \pkg{archivist}, this package aims at making
high-level, robust, machine and OS independent tools for making deeply
reproducible and reusable content in R. This extends beyond the package
management utilities of \pkg{packrat} and \pkg{checkpoint} by including
tools for caching, and accessing GitHub repositories.
}
\section{Main Tools}{


There are many elements within the reproducible package. However, there are currently
3 main ones that are critical for reproducible research. The key element for reproducible
research is that the code must always return the same content every time it is run,
but it must be vastly faster the 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc, time it is run. That way, the entire
code sequence for a project of arbitrary size can be run \code{from the start} every time.

\tabular{lcl}{
  \emph{Function} \tab \emph{Objective} \cr
  \code{Cache} \tab A robust wrapper for any function, including those
                    with environments, disk-backed storage (currently on \code{Raster})
                    class), operating-system independent, whose first time
                    called will execute the function, 2nd time will compare the inputs
                    to a an SQLite database of entries, and recover the first result
                    if inputs are identical. If \code{options("reproducible.useMemoise" = TRUE)},
                    the third time will be very fast as it will recover the answer from
                    RAM\cr
  \code{prepInputs} \tab A function to download, or load objects, and possible post process
                    them. The main advantage to using this over more direct routes is
                    that it will automatically build checksums tables, use \code{Cache}
                    internally where helpful, and possibly run a variety of post processing
                    actions. This means this function can also itself be cached for even
                    more speed. This allows all project data to be stored in custom cloud
                    locations or in their original online data repositories,
                    \code{without altering code} between the first, second, third etc. times
                    the code is run.\cr
  \code{Require} \tab A version of \code{require} that incorporates elements of
                   \code{install.packages}, \code{devtools::install_github}, \code{packrat}.
                   It allows for users code to work for a new user on a new machine that
                   may or may not have all packages installed.\cr
