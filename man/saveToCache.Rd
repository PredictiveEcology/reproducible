\usage{
saveToCache(
  cachePath = getOption("reproducible.cachePath"),
  cacheSaveFormat = getOption("reproducible.cacheSaveFormat"),
  drv = getDrv(getOption("reproducible.drv", NULL)),
  conn = getOption("reproducible.conn", NULL),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{cachePath}{A repository used for storing cached objects.
This is optional if \code{Cache} is used inside a SpaDES module.}

\item{cacheSaveFormat}{Character string: currently either \code{qs} or \code{rds}. Defaults to
\code{getOption("reproducible.cacheSaveFormat")}. \code{qs} is faster but appears to have
narrower range of conditions that work; \code{rds} is safer, but slower.}

\item{drv}{If using a database backend, \code{drv} must be an object that
inherits from \code{DBIDriver} (e.g., \code{RSQLite::SQLite}).}

\item{conn}{an optional \code{DBIConnection} object, as returned by \code{dbConnect()}.}

\item{obj}{The R object to save to the cache}

\item{userTags}{A character vector with descriptions of the Cache function call. These
will be added to the Cache so that this entry in the Cache can be found using
\code{userTags} e.g., via \code{\link[=showCache]{showCache()}}.}

\item{cacheId}{The hash string representing the result of \code{.robustDigest}}

\item{linkToCacheId}{Optional. If a \code{cacheId} is provided here, then a \code{file.link}
will be made to the file with that \code{cacheId} name in the cache repo.
This is used when identical outputs exist in the cache. This will save disk space.}

\item{verbose}{Numeric, -1 silent (where possible), 0 being very quiet,
1 showing more messaging, 2 being more messaging, etc.
Default is 1. Above 3 will output much more information about the internals of
Caching, which may help diagnose Caching challenges. Can set globally with an
option, e.g., \verb{options('reproducible.verbose' = 0) to reduce to minimal}}
}
\value{
This is used for its side effects, namely, it will add the object to the cache and
cache database.
}
\description{
This is not expected to be used by a user as it requires that the \code{cacheId} be
calculated in exactly the same as it calculated inside \code{Cache}
(which requires \code{match.call} to match arguments with their names, among other things).
