\title{Save an object to Cache}
\usage{
saveToCache(
  cachePath = getOption("reproducible.cachePath"),
  drv = getOption("reproducible.drv", RSQLite::SQLite()),
  conn = getOption("reproducible.conn", NULL),
  obj,
  userTags,
  cacheId,
  linkToCacheId = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{drv}{an object that inherits from \linkS4class{DBIDriver},
or an existing \linkS4class{DBIConnection}
object (in order to clone an existing connection).}

\item{conn}{A \linkS4class{DBIConnection} object, as returned by
\code{\link[DBI:dbConnect]{dbConnect()}}.}

\item{obj}{The R object to save to the cache}

\item{userTags}{A character vector with descriptions of the Cache function call. These
will be added to the Cache so that this entry in the Cache can be found using
\code{userTags} e.g., via \code{\link[=showCache]{showCache()}}.}

\item{cacheId}{The hash string representing the result of \code{.robustDigest}}

\item{linkToCacheId}{Optional. If a \code{cacheId} is provided here, then a \code{file.link}
will be made to the file with that \code{cacheId} name in the cache repo.
This is used when identical outputs exist in the cache. This will save disk space.}
}
\value{
This is used for its side effects, namely, it will add the object to the cache and
cache database.
}
\description{
This is not expected to be used by a user as it requires that the \code{cacheId}
be calculated in exactly the same as it calculated inside \code{Cache} (which requires
\code{match.call} to match arguments with their names, amongst other things).
