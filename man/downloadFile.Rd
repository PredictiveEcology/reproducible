\arguments{
\item{archive}{Optional character string giving the path of an archive
containing \code{targetFile}, or a vector giving a set of nested archives
(e.g., \code{c("xxx.tar", "inner.zip", "inner.rar")}). If there is/are (an) inner
archive(s), but they are unknown, the function will try all until it finds
the \code{targetFile}. See table in \code{\link[=preProcess]{preProcess()}}. If it is \code{NA},
then it will \emph{not} attempt to see it as an archive, even if it has archive-like
file extension (e.g., \code{.zip}). This may be useful when an R function
is expecting an archive directly.}

\item{targetFile}{Character string giving the filename (without relative or
absolute path) to the eventual file
(raster, shapefile, csv, etc.) after downloading and extracting from a zip
or tar archive. This is the file \emph{before} it is passed to
\code{postProcess}. The internal checksumming does not checksum
the file after it is \code{postProcess}ed (e.g., cropped/reprojected/masked).
Using \code{Cache} around \code{prepInputs} will do a sufficient job in these cases.
See table in \code{\link[=preProcess]{preProcess()}}.}

\item{neededFiles}{Character string giving the name of the file(s) to be extracted.}

\item{destinationPath}{Character string of a directory in which to download
and save the file that comes from \code{url} and is also where the function
will look for \code{archive} or \code{targetFile}. NOTE (still experimental):
To prevent repeated downloads in different locations, the user can also set
\code{options("reproducible.inputPaths")} to one or more local file paths to
search for the file before attempting to download. Default for that option is
\code{NULL} meaning do not search locally.}

\item{quick}{Logical. This is passed internally to \code{\link[=Checksums]{Checksums()}}
(the quickCheck argument), and to
\code{\link[=Cache]{Cache()}} (the quick argument). This results in faster, though
less robust checking of inputs. See the respective functions.}

\item{checksumFile}{A character string indicating the absolute path to the \code{CHECKSUMS.txt}
file.}

\item{dlFun}{Optional "download function" name, such as \code{"raster::getData"}, which does
custom downloading, in addition to loading into R. Still experimental.}

\item{checkSums}{A checksums file, e.g., created by Checksums(..., write = TRUE)}

\item{url}{Optional character string indicating the URL to download from.
If not specified, then no download will be attempted. If not entry
exists in the \code{CHECKSUMS.txt} (in \code{destinationPath}), an entry
will be created or appended to. This \code{CHECKSUMS.txt} entry will be used
in subsequent calls to
\code{prepInputs} or \code{preProcess}, comparing the file on hand with the ad hoc
\code{CHECKSUMS.txt}. See table in \code{\link[=preProcess]{preProcess()}}.}

\item{needChecksums}{A numeric, with \code{0} indicating do not write a new checksums,
\code{1} write a new one,
\code{2} append new information to existing one.}

\item{preDigest}{The list of \code{preDigest} that comes from \code{CacheDigest} of an object}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Should downloading and all the other actions occur
even if they pass the checksums or the files are all there.}

\item{alsoExtract}{Optional character string naming files other than
\code{targetFile} that must be extracted from the \code{archive}. If
\code{NULL}, the default, then it will extract all files. Other options:
\code{"similar"} will extract all files with the same filename without
file extension as \code{targetFile}. \code{NA} will extract nothing other
than \code{targetFile}. A character string of specific file names will cause
only those to be extracted. See table in \code{\link[=preProcess]{preProcess()}}.}

\item{verbose}{Numeric, -1 silent (where possible), 0 being very quiet,
1 showing more messaging, 2 being more messaging, etc.
Default is 1. Above 3 will output much more information about the internals of
Caching, which may help diagnose Caching challenges. Can set globally with an
option, e.g., \verb{options('reproducible.verbose' = 0) to reduce to minimal}}

\item{purge}{Logical or Integer. \code{0/FALSE} (default) keeps existing \code{CHECKSUMS.txt} file and
\code{prepInputs} will write or append to it. \code{1/TRUE} will deleted the entire \code{CHECKSUMS.txt} file.
Other options, see details.}

\item{.tempPath}{Optional temporary path for internal file intermediate steps.
Will be cleared \code{on.exit} from this function.}

\item{.callingEnv}{The environment where the function was called from. Used to find
objects, if necessary.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{dlFun}. Still experimental. Can be e.g., \code{type} for google docs.}
}
\value{
This function is called for its side effects, which will be a downloaded file
(\code{targetFile}), placed in \code{destinationPath}. This file will be checksummed, and
that checksum will be appended to the \code{checksumFile}.
}
\description{
Currently, this only deals with \code{googledrive::drive_download},
and \code{\link[utils:download.file]{utils::download.file()}}. In general, this is not intended for use by a
user.
