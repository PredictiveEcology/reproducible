\arguments{
\item{x}{A simList or a directory containing a valid Cache repository. Note:
For compatibility with \code{Cache} argument, \code{cacheRepo} can also be
used instead of \code{x}, though \code{x} will take precedence.}

\item{userTags}{Character vector. If used, this will be used in place of the
\code{after} and \code{before}.
Specifying one or more \code{userTag} here will clear all
objects that match those tags.
Matching is via regular expression, meaning partial matches
will work unless strict beginning (^) and end ($) of string
characters are used.
Matching will be against any of the 3 columns returned by \code{showCache()},
i.e., \code{artifact}, \code{tagValue} or \code{tagName}.
Also, length \code{userTags} > 1, then matching is by `and`.
For `or` matching, use \code{|} in a single character string.
See examples.}

\item{after}{A time (POSIX, character understandable by data.table).
Objects cached after this time will be shown or deleted.}

\item{before}{A time (POSIX, character understandable by data.table).
Objects cached before this time will be shown or deleted.}

\item{ask}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, then it will not ask to confirm deletions using
\code{clearCache} or \code{keepCache}. Default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{useCloud}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then every object that is deleted locally will
also be deleted in the \code{cloudFolderID}, if it is non-\code{NULL}}

\item{cloudFolderID}{A googledrive dribble of a folder, e.g., using \code{drive_mkdir()}.
If left as \code{NULL}, the function will create a cloud folder with name from last
two folder levels of the \code{cacheRepo} path, :
\code{paste0(basename(dirname(cacheRepo)), "_", basename(cacheRepo))}.
This \code{cloudFolderID} will be added to \code{options("reproducible.cloudFolderID")},
but this will not persist across sessions. If this is a character string, it will
treat this as a folder name to create or use on GoogleDrive.}

\item{drv}{Either \code{"fst"} (the character string) the default as of reproducible V 1.2.9,
or an object that inherits from \code{DBIDriver}, or an existing \code{DBIConnection} object
(in order to clone an existing connection). For these last two, user requires \code{DBI}
and a DB backend such as \code{RSQLite} to be installed.}

\item{conn}{Either the character string of the path to the `fst` file that is the
cacheRepo file, or optionally (requires \code{DBI} and a DB backend such as \code{RSQLite})
a DBIConnection object, as returned by \code{dbConnect()}}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Currently, \code{regexp}, a logical, can be provided.
This must be \code{TRUE} if the use is passing a regular expression.
Otherwise, \code{userTags} will need to be exact matches. Default is
missing, which is the same as \code{TRUE}. If there are errors due
to regular expression problem, try \code{FALSE}. For \code{cc}, it is
passed to \code{clearCache}, e.g., \code{ask}, \code{userTags}}

\item{secs}{Currently 3 options: the number of seconds to pass to \code{clearCache(after = secs)},
a \code{POSIXct} time e.g., from \code{Sys.time()}, or missing. If missing,
        the default, then it will delete the most recent entry in the Cache.}
}
\value{
Will clear all objects (or those that match \code{userTags}, or those
between \code{after} or \code{before}) from the repository located at
\code{cachePath} of the sim object, if \code{sim} is provided, or located in
\code{cacheRepo}.
Invisibly returns a \code{data.table} of the removed items.
}
\description{
These are convenience wrappers around \code{DBI} package functions.
They allow the user a bit of control over what is being cached.
}
\details{
If neither \code{after} or \code{before} are provided, nor \code{userTags},
then all objects will be removed.
If both \code{after} and \code{before} are specified, then all objects between
\code{after} and \code{before} will be deleted.
If \code{userTags} is used, this will override \code{after} or \code{before}.

\code{cc(secs)} is just a shortcut for \code{clearCache(repo = Paths$cachePath, after = secs)},
i.e., to remove any cache entries touched in the last \code{secs} seconds.

\describe{
  \item{\code{clearCache}}{remove items from the cache based on their
                           \code{userTag} or \code{times} values.}
  \item{\code{keepCache}}{remove all cached items \emph{except} those based on
                          certain \code{userTags} or \code{times} values.}
  \item{\code{showCache}}{display the contents of the cache.}
}
}
\note{
If the cache is larger than 10MB, and clearCache is used, there will be
a message and a pause, if interactive, to prevent accidentally deleting of a
large cache repository.
