\title{Copy the file-backing of a file-backed Raster* object}
\usage{
prepareFileBackedRaster(obj, repoDir = NULL,
  compareRasterFileLength = 1e+06, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{The raster object to save to the repository.}

\item{repoDir}{Character denoting an existing directory in which an artifact will be saved.}

\item{compareRasterFileLength}{Numeric. Optional. When there are Rasters, that
have file-backed storage, this is passed to the length arg in \code{digest}
when determining if the Raster file is already in the database.
Note: uses \code{\link[digest]{digest}} for file-backed Raster.
Default 1e6. Passed to \code{prepareFileBackedRaster}.}

\item{...}{passed to \code{archivist::saveToRepo}}
}
\value{
A raster object and its newly located file backing.
        Note that if this is a legitimate archivist repository, the new location
        will be a subfolder called \file{rasters/} of \file{repoDir/}.
        If this is not a repository, the new location will be within \code{repoDir}.
}
\description{
Rasters are sometimes file-based, so the normal save and copy and assign
mechanisms in R don't work for saving, copying and assigning.
This function creates an explicit file copy of the file that is backing the raster,
and changes the pointer (i.e., \code{filename(object)}) so that it is pointing to the new
file.
