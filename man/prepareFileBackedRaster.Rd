\title{Copy the file-backing of a file-backed Raster* object}
\usage{
.prepareFileBackedRaster(
  obj,
  cacheRepo = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  cacheId = NULL,
  drv = getOption("reproducible.drv"),
  conn = getOption("reproducible.conn", NULL),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{The raster object to save to the repository.}

\item{cacheRepo}{Character denoting an existing directory in which an artifact will be saved.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Should the raster be saved to disk, overwriting existing file.}

\item{cacheId}{Character string of the hash of the object being affected. This is used when
stashing the file-backed raster if it is in the Cache repository.}

\item{drv}{Either \code{"csv"} ( the default as of reproducible V 1.2.9) or
an object that inherits from
\code{DBIDriver}, or an existing \code{DBIConnection} object
(in order to clone an existing connection). For these last two, user requires \code{DBI}
and a DB backend such as \code{RSQLite} to be installed.}

\item{conn}{Either the character string of the path to the `csv` file that is the
cacheRepo file, or optionally (requires \code{DBI} and a DB backend such as \code{RSQLite})
a DBIConnection object, as returned by \code{dbConnect()}}

\item{...}{Not used}
}
\value{
A raster object and its newly located file backing.
        Note that if this is a legitimate Cache repository, the new location
        will be a subdirectory called \file{rasters/} of \file{cacheRepo/}.
        If this is not a repository, the new location will be within \code{cacheRepo}.
}
\description{
Rasters are sometimes file-based, so the normal save and copy and assign
mechanisms in R don't work for saving, copying and assigning.
This function creates an explicit file copy of the file that is backing the raster,
and changes the pointer (i.e., \code{filename(object)}) so that it is pointing
to the new file.
}
\examples{
library(terra)
# make a cache repository
a <- Cache(rnorm, 1)

r <- rast(ext(0,10,0,10), vals = 1:100)

# write to disk manually -- will be in tempdir()
r <- writeRaster(r, file = tempfile(fileext = ".tif"))
Filenames(r) # in tempdir()

# copy it to a different directory
r <- .prepareFileBackedRaster(r, file.path(tempdir(), "test"))
Filenames(r) # now in a different place in tempdir()
