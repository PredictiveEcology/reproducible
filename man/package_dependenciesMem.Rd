\title{Memoised version of package_dependencies}
\usage{
package_dependenciesMem(packages = NULL, db = NULL, which = c("Depends",
  "Imports", "LinkingTo"), recursive = FALSE, reverse = FALSE,
  verbose = getOption("verbose"))
}
\arguments{
\item{packages}{a character vector of package names.}

\item{db}{character matrix as from \code{\link{available.packages}()}
    (with the default \code{NULL} the results of this call)
    or data frame variants thereof.  Alternatively, a package database
    like the one available from
    \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/packages.rds}.
  }

\item{which}{a character vector listing the types of
    dependencies, a subset of
    \code{c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests", "Enhances")}.
    Character string \code{"all"} is shorthand for that vector,
    character string \code{"most"} for the same vector without
    \code{"Enhances"}.
  }

\item{recursive}{logical: should (reverse) dependencies of (reverse)
    dependencies (and so on) be included?}

\item{reverse}{logical: if \code{FALSE} (default), regular
    dependencies are calculated, otherwise reverse dependencies.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if output should monitor the package
    search cycles.}
