\usage{
.guessAtTargetAndFun(
  targetFilePath,
  destinationPath = getOption("reproducible.destinationPath", "."),
  filesExtracted,
  fun = NULL,
  verbose = getOption("reproducible.verbose", 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{destinationPath}{Full path of the directory where the target file should be}

\item{filesExtracted}{A character vector of all files that have been extracted (e.g.,
from an archive)}

\item{verbose}{Numeric, -1 silent (where possible), 0 being very quiet,
1 showing more messaging, 2 being more messaging, etc.
Default is 1. Above 3 will output much more information about the internals of
Caching, which may help diagnose Caching challenges. Can set globally with an
option, e.g., \verb{options('reproducible.verbose' = 0) to reduce to minimal}}
