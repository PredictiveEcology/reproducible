\usage{
cloudDownload(
  outputHash,
  gdriveLs,
  cacheRepo,
  cloudFolderID,
  drv = getOption("reproducible.drv"),
  conn = getOption("reproducible.conn", NULL)
)

cloudClearCache(cloudFolderID = NULL)

cloudCacheBrowse(cloudFolderID = NULL)

cloudFolderFromCacheRepo(cacheRepo)
}
\arguments{
\item{cacheRepo}{A repository used for storing cached objects.
This is optional if \code{Cache} is used inside a SpaDES module.}

\item{cloudFolderID}{A googledrive dribble of a folder, e.g., using \code{drive_mkdir()}.
If left as \code{NULL}, the function will create a cloud folder with name from last
two folder levels of the \code{cacheRepo} path, :
\code{paste0(basename(dirname(cacheRepo)), "_", basename(cacheRepo))}.
This \code{cloudFolderID} will be added to \code{options("reproducible.cloudFolderID")},
but this will not persist across sessions. If this is a character string, it will
treat this as a folder name to create or use on GoogleDrive.}

\item{drv}{Either \code{"fst"} (the character string) the default as of reproducible V 1.2.9,
or an object that inherits from \code{DBIDriver}, or an existing \code{DBIConnection} object
(in order to clone an existing connection). For these last two, user requires \code{DBI}
and a DB backend such as \code{RSQLite} to be installed.}

\item{conn}{Either the character string of the path to the `fst` file that is the
cacheRepo file, or optionally (requires \code{DBI} and a DB backend such as \code{RSQLite})
a DBIConnection object, as returned by \code{dbConnect()}}
}
\description{
Meant for internal use, as there are internal objects as arguments.

This is a convenience function that removes all the files in \code{cloudFolderID}.
To fully remove the entire \code{cloudFolderID} directory, use
\code{googledrive::drive_trash(cloudFolderID)}.
}
\details{
\code{cloudCacheBrowse} will open up a browser at the current cloudFolderID.
