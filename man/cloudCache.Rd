\arguments{
\item{cacheRepo}{A repository used for storing cached objects.
This is optional if \code{Cache} is used inside a SpaDES module.}

\item{cloudFolderID}{A googledrive dribble of a folder, e.g., using \code{drive_mkdir()}.
If left as \code{NULL}, the function will create a cloud folder with name from last
two folder levels of the \code{cacheRepo} path, :
\code{paste0(basename(dirname(cacheRepo)), "_", basename(cacheRepo))}.
This \code{cloudFolderID} will be added to \code{options("reproducible.cloudFolderID")},
but this will not persist across sessions. If this is a character string, it will
treat this as a folder name to create or use on GoogleDrive.}

\item{drv}{Either \code{"fst"} (the character string) the default as of reproducible V 1.2.9,
or an object that inherits from \code{DBIDriver}, or an existing \code{DBIConnection} object
(in order to clone an existing connection). For these last two, user requires \code{DBI}
and a DB backend such as \code{RSQLite} to be installed.}

\item{conn}{Either the character string of the path to the `fst` file that is the
cacheRepo file, or optionally (requires \code{DBI} and a DB backend such as \code{RSQLite})
a DBIConnection object, as returned by \code{dbConnect()}}

\item{userTags}{A character vector with descriptions of the Cache function call. These
will be added to the Cache so that this entry in the Cache can be found using
\code{userTags} e.g., via \code{\link{showCache}}.}
}
\description{
Meant for internal use, as there are internal objects as arguments.

This is a convenience function that removes all the files in \code{cloudFolderID}.
To fully remove the entire \code{cloudFolderID} directory, use
\code{googledrive::drive_trash(cloudFolderID)}.
}
\details{
\code{cloudCacheBrowse} will open up a browser at the current cloudFolderID.

\code{cloudShowCache} is the equivalent to \code{\link{showCache}}, but only
for a \code{cloudFolderID}. This works by identifying the database file in the
\code{cloudFolderID}, downloading that file to a local, temporary file location,
then reading from it. It will remove the temporary file on completion. This
\code{showCloudCache} will have no relationship to \code{showCache}; if the
user would like to see what objects in the current local \code{cacheRepo} are
in the cloud, use \code{showCache(cacheRepo)},
which will have a \code{tagKey} of `inCloud` and a \code{tagValue} `TRUE`.
