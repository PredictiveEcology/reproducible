\usage{
dlGeneric(url, destinationPath, verbose = getOption("reproducible.verbose", 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The url (link) to the file.}

\item{destinationPath}{Character string of a directory in which to download
and save the file that comes from \code{url} and is also where the function
will look for \code{archive} or \code{targetFile}. NOTE (still experimental):
To prevent repeated downloads in different locations, the user can also set
\code{options("reproducible.inputPaths")} to one or more local file paths to
search for the file before attempting to download. Default for that option is
\code{NULL} meaning do not search locally.}

\item{verbose}{Numeric, -1 silent (where possible), 0 being very quiet,
1 showing more messaging, 2 being more messaging, etc.
Default is 1. Above 3 will output much more information about the internals of
Caching, which may help diagnose Caching challenges. Can set globally with an
option, e.g., \verb{options('reproducible.verbose' = 0) to reduce to minimal}}

\item{needChecksums}{Logical indicating whether to generate checksums. ## TODO: add overwrite arg to the function?}
