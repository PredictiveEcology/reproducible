  cloudFolderID = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{cloudFolderID}{The google folder ID where cloud caching will occur.}

\item{cacheRepo}{A repository used for storing cached objects.
This is optional if \code{Cache} is used inside a SpaDES module.}

\item{create}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the \code{cloudFolderID} will be created.
This should be used with caution as there are no checks for overwriting.
See \code{googledrive::drive_mkdir}. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Passed to \code{googledrive::drive_mkdir}.}

\item{verbose}{Numeric, -1 silent (where possible), 0 being very quiet,
1 showing more messaging, 2 being more messaging, etc.
Default is 1. Above 3 will output much more information about the internals of
Caching, which may help diagnose Caching challenges. Can set globally with an
option, e.g., \code{options('reproducible.verbose' = 0) to reduce to minimal}}

\item{team_drive}{Logical indicating whether to check team drives.}
}
\value{
The \code{cloudFolderID} as a \code{dribble}, which will also be assigned to
\code{options("reproducible.cloudFolderID")} so that it can be used again.
}
\description{
Will check for presence of a \code{cloudFolderID} and optionally create a new one
if one not present on Google Drive. The function will determine the cloudFolderID using the
first non-NULL, non-empty result in the following sequence, in this order: 1. Supplied as
argument, 2. \code{getOption("reproducible.cloudFolderID")}, 3.
\code{Sys.getenv("reproducible.cloudFolderID")}, 4. determined from the \code{cacheRepo},
using \code{cloudFolderFromCacheRepo(cacheRepo)}. Once a cloudFolder has been created,
its googledrive ID must be saved or else it may be difficult to find it again. For
this reason, whatever result is found with this function, it will be assigned
to \code{options("reproducible.cloudFolderID")} so that it can be used again.
