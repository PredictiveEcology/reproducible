\title{Remove \code{quote} and determine if call uses \code{...}}
\usage{
getCallDetailsStart(call)
}
\arguments{
\item{call}{The matched call from \code{cache2}}
}
\value{
A named list with \code{call} (the original call, without \code{quote}),
\code{FUNorig}, the original value passed by user to \code{FUN}, and \code{usesDots} which
is a logical indicating whether the \code{...} are used.
}
\description{
Minor cleaning up of the \code{FUN} and \code{...} to be used subsequently. This does only very minor
things as it is run even if \code{useCache = FALSE}, i.e., even if the \code{Cache} is skipped.
}
