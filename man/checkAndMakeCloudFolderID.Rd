\usage{
checkAndMakeCloudFolderID(
  cloudFolderID = getOption("reproducible.cloudFolderID", NULL),
  cacheRepo = NULL,
  create = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  verbose = getOption("reproducible.verbose", 1),
  team_drive = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cloudFolderID}{The google folder ID where cloud caching will occur.}

\item{cacheRepo}{A repository used for storing cached objects.
This is optional if \code{Cache} is used inside a SpaDES module.}

\item{create}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the \code{cloudFolderID} will be created.
This should be used with caution as there are no checks for overwriting.
See \code{googledrive::drive_mkdir}. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Passed to \code{googledrive::drive_mkdir}.}

\item{verbose}{Numeric, -1 silent (where possible), 0 being very quiet,
1 showing more messaging, 2 being more messaging, etc.
Default is 1. Above 3 will output much more information about the internals of
Caching, which may help diagnose Caching challenges. Can set globally with an
option, e.g., \verb{options('reproducible.verbose' = 0) to reduce to minimal}}

\item{team_drive}{Logical indicating whether to check team drives.}
}
\value{
Returns the character string of the cloud folder ID created or reported
}
\description{
Will check for presence of a \code{cloudFolderID} and make a new one
if one not present on Google Drive, with a warning.
