\title{Upload to cloud, if necessary}
\usage{
cloudUpload(isInRepo, outputHash, gdriveLs, cachePath, cloudFolderID, output)
}
\arguments{
\item{isInRepo}{A data.table with the information about an object that is in the local cachePath}

\item{outputHash}{The \code{cacheId} of the object to upload}

\item{gdriveLs}{The result of \code{googledrive::drive_ls(googledrive::as_id(cloudFolderID), pattern = "outputHash")}}

\item{cachePath}{A repository used for storing cached objects.
This is optional if \code{Cache} is used inside a SpaDES module.}

\item{cloudFolderID}{A googledrive dribble of a folder, e.g., using \code{drive_mkdir()}.
If left as \code{NULL}, the function will create a cloud folder with name from last
two folder levels of the \code{cachePath} path, :
\code{paste0(basename(dirname(cachePath)), "_", basename(cachePath))}.
This \code{cloudFolderID} will be added to \code{options("reproducible.cloudFolderID")},
but this will not persist across sessions. If this is a character string, it will
treat this as a folder name to create or use on GoogleDrive.}

\item{output}{The output object of FUN that was run in \code{Cache}}
}
\description{
Meant for internal use, as there are internal objects as arguments.
