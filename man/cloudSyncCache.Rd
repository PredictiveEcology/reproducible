\usage{
cloudSyncCache(cacheRepo = getOption("reproducible.cachePath")[1],
  checksumsFileID = NULL, cloudFolderID = NULL, delete = TRUE,
  upload = TRUE, ask = getOption("reproducible.ask"),
  cacheIds = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cacheRepo}{See \code{x} in \code{\link{showCache}}}

\item{checksumsFileID}{A google file ID where the checksums data.table is located,
provided as a character string.}

\item{cloudFolderID}{The google folder ID where a new checksums file should
 be written. This will only be used if \code{checksumsFileID} is not provided
provided as a character string.}

\item{delete}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the default, it will delete any objects
that are in \code{cloudFolderID} that are absent from local \code{cacheRepo}.
If \code{FALSE}, it will not delete objects.}

\item{upload}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the default, it will upload any objects
identified by the internal \code{showCache(...)} call. See examples. If \code{FALSE},
then no files will be uploaded. Can be used in conjunction with \code{delete}
to create behaviours similar to \code{clearCache} and \code{keepCache}.}

\item{ask}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, then it will not ask to confirm deletions using
\code{clearCache} or \code{keepCache}. Default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{cacheIds}{If supplied, then only this/these cacheId objects
will be uploaded or deleted. Default is \code{NULL}, meaning do
full sync (i.e., match cloudFolder with local cacheRepo, constrained by
\code{delete} or \code{upload})}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{showCache} to get the artifacts to delete}

This is still experimental, see examples.

\code{cloudSyncCache} will remove any entries in a cloudCache that are not in a
