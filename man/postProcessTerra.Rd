\arguments{
\item{from}{A RasterLayer, RasterStack, RasterBrick, SpatRaster to do one or more of:
crop, project, mask, and write}

\item{to}{A gridded (\code{Raster*} or \code{SpatRaster}) or polygonal
(\code{Spatial*}, \code{sf} or \code{Spat*}) class object which is the object
whose metadata will be the target for cropping, projecting, and masking of \code{from}.}

\item{cropTo}{Optional \code{Raster*}, \code{Spatial*}, \code{sf} or \code{Spat*} which,
if supplied, will supply the extent with which to crop \code{from}. To omit
cropping completed, set this to \code{NULL}. If supplied, this will be used instead of \code{to}
for the cropping step. Defaults to \code{to}}

\item{projectTo}{Optional \code{Raster*} or \code{SpatRaster} which,
if supplied, will supply the \code{crs}, \code{extent}, \code{res}, and \code{origin}
to project the \code{from} to. To omit projecting, set this to NULL.
If supplied, this will be used instead of \code{to}
for the projecting step. Defaults to \code{to}.}

\item{maskTo}{Optional \code{Spatial*}, \code{Raster*}, \code{sf} or \code{Spat*} which,
if supplied, will supply the extent with which to mask \code{from}. To omit
masking completed, set this to \code{NULL}. If supplied, this will be used instead of \code{to}
for the masking step. Defaults to \code{to}}

\item{writeTo}{Optional character string of a filename to use `writeRaster` to save the final
object. Default is \code{NULL}, which means there is no `writeRaster`}

\item{method}{Used if \code{projectTo} is not \code{NULL}, and is the method used for
interpolation. See \code{terra::project}}

\item{datatype}{A character string, used if \code{writeTo} is not \code{NULL}. See \code{raster::writeRaster}}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Used if \code{writeTo} is not \code{NULL}}

\item{...}{Currently can be either \code{rasterToMatch}, \code{studyArea}, \code{filename2}
to allow backwards
compatibility with \code{postProcess}. \code{rasterToMatch} will be assigned to \code{to}
and \code{studyArea} will be assigned to \code{cropTo} & \code{maskTo}. These will override any values
passed to \code{to} or \code{maskTo}. \code{filename2} will be passed to \code{writeTo}.}
}
\value{
An object of the same class as \code{from}, but potentially cropped, projected, masked,
and written to disk.
}
\description{
This function provides a single step to achieve the GIS operations "crop", "project",
"mask" and possibly "write". It uses primarily the \code{terra} package internally
(with some minor functions from \code{sf} and \code{raster})
in an attempt to be as efficient as possible.
}
\details{
Below, "gridded" means a \code{Raster*} or \code{SpatRaster} class object.
"Vector" means \code{Spatial*} from \code{sp}, \code{sf} from \code{sf}, or
\code{SpatVector} from \code{terra}.
}
\section{\code{from} and \code{to} are both gridded}{

Use case one is supply 2 gridded objects, \code{from} and \code{to}. This function
will make \code{from} look like \code{to}, i.e., the extent, projection, origin, and masking
where there are \code{NA} in the {to} will be the same as \code{from}.
}

\section{\code{from} is gridded, \code{to} is Vector}{

Use case two is \code{from} is a gridded dataset (\code{Raster*} or \code{SpatRaster})
and \code{to} is a Vector gis dataset (specifically:
(e.g., \code{Spatial*} from \code{sp}, \code{sf} from \code{sf}, or
\code{SpatVector} from \code{terra}) that has information we want to impose on \code{from}.
It can be supplied as \code{to}, \code{projectTo}, \code{cropTo} or \code{maskTo}.
}

\section{any of \code{*To} arguments}{

if one or more of the \code{*To} arguments are supplied, these will
override individual components of \code{to}. If \code{to} is omitted, then only
the \code{*To} arguments that are used will be performed.
}

\section{\code{from} and \code{to} are both Vector}{

Use case four is when \code{from} is a Vector dataset and \code{to} or any of the \code{*To}
arguments are also Vector datasets. Similar to case 2 above, it will convert the \code{from}
by doing one or more of crop, project, mask, and write to disk. In the case of the
mask step, it will first aggregate (dissolve) all polygons so it is one single
polygon prior to doing the mask (which is actually \code{terra::intersect})
