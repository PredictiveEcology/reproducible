\title{Purge individual line items from checksums file}
\usage{
.purge(checkSums, purge, targetFile, archive, alsoExtract, url)
}
\arguments{
\item{checkSums}{A checksums file, e.g., created by Checksums(..., write = TRUE)}

\item{purge}{Logical or Integer. \code{0/FALSE} (default) keeps existing
\code{CHECKSUMS.txt} file and
\code{prepInputs} will write or append to it. \code{1/TRUE} will deleted the entire
\code{CHECKSUMS.txt} file. Other options, see details.}

\item{targetFile}{Character string giving the path to the eventual file
(raster, shapefile, csv, etc.) after downloading and extracting from a zip
or tar archive. This is the file \emph{before} it is passed to
\code{postProcess}. Currently, the internal checksumming does not checksum
the file after it is \code{postProcess}ed (e.g., cropped/reprojected/masked).
Using \code{Cache} around \code{prepInputs} will do a sufficient job in these cases.}

\item{archive}{Optional character string giving the path of an archive
containing \code{targetFile}, or a vector giving a set of nested archives
(e.g., \code{c("xxx.tar", "inner.zip")}). If there is/are (an) inner
archive(s), but they are unknown, the function will try all until it finds
the \code{targetFile}}

\item{url}{Optional character string indicating the URL to download from.
Normally, if used within a module, this url should be explicitly given as
sourceURL for an \code{expectsInput}. In that case, it will use the
module's checksums file to confirm that the download occurred correctly. If
URL is used here, an ad hoc checksums will be created in the
\code{destinationPath}. This will be used in subsequent calls to
\code{prepInputs}, comparing the file on hand with the ad hoc
\code{CHECKSUMS.txt}.}
