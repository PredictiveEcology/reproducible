\title{Determine versions all installed pacakges}
\usage{
installedVersions(packages, libPath)
}
\arguments{
\item{packages}{Character vector of packages to determine which version is
installed in the \code{libPath}.}

\item{libPath}{The library path where all packages should be installed, and looked for to load
(i.e., call \code{library})}
}
\description{
This code is adapted from \code{\link[versions]{installed.versions}},
but uses an \code{Rcpp} alternative to readLines for speed.
It will be anywhere from 2x to 10x faster than the
\code{\link[versions]{installed.versions}} function.
This is also many times faster than \code{utils::installed.packages},
especially if only a subset of "all" packages in \code{libPath} are desired
(1000x ? for the 1 package case).

installedVersions("reproducible", .libPaths()[1])
