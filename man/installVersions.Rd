\title{Install exact package versions from a package version text file & GitHub}
\usage{
installVersions(gitHubPackages, packageVersionFile = ".packageVersions.txt",
  libPath = .libPaths()[1], standAlone = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gitHubPackages}{Character vectors indicating repository/packageName@branch}

\item{packageVersionFile}{Path to the package version file, defaults to
the \code{.packageVersions.txt}.}

\item{libPath}{The library path where all packages should be installed, and looked for to load
(i.e., call \code{library})}

\item{standAlone}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, all packages will be installed and loaded strictly
from the \code{libPaths} only. If \code{FALSE}, all \code{.libPaths} will
be used to find the correct versions. This can be create dramatically faster
installs if the user has a substantial number of the packages already in their
personal library. In the case of \code{TRUE}, there will be a hidden file
place in the \code{libPath} directory that lists all the packages that were needed
during the Require call.}
}
\description{
This uses CRAN, CRAN archives, or MRAN (accessed via \code{versions::install.versions})
for remote repositories.
This will attempt to install all packages in the \code{packageVersionFile},
with their exact version described in that file. For GitHub packages, it will
use \code{\link[devtools]{install_github}}. This will be called internally by
\code{Require}, and so often doesn't need to be used by a user.
}
\details{
Because of potential conflicts with loaded packages, this function will run
\code{install.packages} in a separate R process.

# requires the packageVersionFile -- this doesn't work -- safer to use Require

pkgSnapshot(libPath=tempPkgFolder, packageVersionFile)

tempPkgFolder <- file.path(tempdir(), "Packages")

# install a specific version
# make a package version snapshot

pkgSnapshot(libPath=tempPkgFolder, packageVersionFile)

installVersions("crayon", packageVersionFile = packageVersionFile)
