version 0.2.2
=============

## New features

* option on non-Windows OSs to use `future` for `Cache` saving to SQLite database, via `options("reproducible.futurePlan")`, if the `future` package is installed. This is `FALSE` by default. Though `future` works on Windows, there were no speed advantages to using it.
* `future` package is now in suggests
* fix problems with tests introduced by recent `git2r` update (@stewid, #36).
* If a `do.call` function is Cached, previously, it would be labelled in the database as `do.call`. Now it attempts to extract the actual function being called by the `do.call`. Messaging is similarly changed.
* new option `reproducible.ask`, logical, indicating whether `clearCache` should ask for deletions when in an interactive session
* `prepInputs`, `preProcess` and `downloadFile` now have `dlFun`, to pass a custom function for downloading (e.g., "raster::getData")
* `prepInputs` will automatically use `readRDS` if the file is a `.rds` 
* `prepInputs` will return a `list` if `fun = "base::load"`, with a message; can still pass an `envir` to obtain standard behaviour of `base::load`
* `clearCache` - new argument "ask"
* new functions

    - `assessDataType` - will identify smallest `datatype` for Raster* objects, if user does not pass an explicity `datatype` in `prepInputs` or `postProcess`

## Bug fixes

* .prepareRasterBackedFile -- now will postpend an incremented numeric to a cached copy of a file-backed Raster object, if it already exists. This mirrors the behaviour of the `.rda` file. Previously, if 2 Cache events returned the same file name backing a Raster object, even if the content was different, it would allow the same file name. If either cached object was deleted, therefore, it would cause the other one to break as its file-backing would be missing.
* options were wrongly pointing to spades.XX and should have been reproducible.XX
* `copyFile` did not perform correctly under all cases; now better handling of these cases, often sending to `file.copy` (slower, but more reliable)
* `extractFromArchive` needed a new `Checksum` function call under some circumstances
* several other minor bug fixes.
* prepInputs -- arguments that were same as Cache (e.g., `useCache`) were not being correctly passed internally to Cache, and if wrapped in Cache, it was not passed into prepInputs. Fixed.
* extracxtFromArchive - when dealing with nested zips, not all args were passed in recursively (fix c/o Ceres Barros)
* `.prepareFileBackedRaster` was failing in some cases (specifically if it was inside a `do.call`). Identified by Ceres Barros.
* `Cache` was failing under some cases of `Cache(do.call, ...)`. Fixed.
* `Cache` - when arguments to Cache were the same as the arguments in `FUN`, Cache would "take" them. Now, they are correctly passed to the `FUN`.
* `preProcess` -- writing to checksums may have produced a warning if `CHECKSUMS.txt` was not present. Now it does not.
* other minor bugfixes


## Minor changes

- most tests now use a standardized approach to attaching libraries, creating objects, paths, enabling easier, error resistent test building

version 0.2.1
=============

## New features

* new functions: 

    - `convertPaths` and `convertRasterPaths` to assist with renaming moved files.
    
* `prepInputs` -- new features

    - `alsoExtract` now has more options (`NULL`, `NA`, `"similar"`) and defaults to extracting all files in an archive (`NULL`).
    - skips `postProcess` altogether if no `studyArea` or `rasterToMatch`. Previously, this would invoke Cache even if there was nothing to `postProcess`.
    
## Bug fixes

* `copyFile` correctly handles directory names containing spaces.
* `makeMemoisable` fixed to handle additonal edge cases.
* other minor bug fixes.

version 0.2.0
=============

## New features

* new functions: 

    - `prepInputs` to aid in data downloading and preparation problems, solved in a reproducible, Cache-aware way.
    - `postProcess` which is a wrapper for sequences of several other new functions (`cropInputs`, `fixErrors`, `projectInputs`, `maskInputs`, `writeOutputs`, and `determineFilename`) 
    - `downloadFile` can handle Google Drive and ftp/http(s) files
    - `zipCache` and `mergeCache`
    - `compareNA` does comparisons with NA as a possible value e.g., `compareNA(c(1,NA), c(2, NA))` returns `FALSE, TRUE`

* Cache -- new features:

    - new arguments `showSimilar`, `verbose` which can help with debugging
    - new argument `useCache` which allows turning caching on and off at a high level (e.g., options("useCache"))
    - new argument `cacheId` which allows user to hard code a result from a Cache
    - deprecated arguments: `digestPathContent` --> `quick`, `compareRasterFileLength` --> `length`
    - Cache arguments now propagate inward to nested `Cache` function calls, unless explicitly set on the inner functions
    - more precise messages provided upon each use
    - many more `userTags` added automatically to cache entries so much more powerful searching via `showCache(userTags="something")`

* `checksums` now returns a data.table with the same columns whether `write = TRUE` or `write = FALSE`. 
* `clearCache` and `showCache` now give messages and require user intervention if request to `clearCache` would be large quantities of data deleted
* `memoise::memoise` now used on 3rd run through an identical `Cache` call, dramatically speeding up in most cases
* new options: `reproducible.cachePath`, `reproducible.quick`, `reproducible.useMemoise`, `reproducible.useCache`, `reproducible.useragent`, `reproducible.verbose`
* `asPath` has a new argument indicating how deep should the path be considered when included in caching (only relevant when `quick = TRUE`)
* New vignette on using Cache
* Cache is `parallel`-safe, meaning there are `tryCatch` around every attempt at writing to SQLite database so it can be used safely on multi-threaded machines
* bug fixes, unit tests, more `imports` for packages e.g., `stats`
* updates for R 3.6.0 compact storage of sequence vectors
* experimental pipes (`%>%`, `%C%`) and assign `%<%`
* several performance enhancements

version 0.1.4
=============

* `mergeCache`: a new function to merge two different Cache repositories
* `memoise::memoise` is now used on `loadFromLocalRepo`, meaning that the 3rd time `Cache()` is run on the same arguments (and the 2nd time in a session), the returned Cache will be from a RAM object via memoise. To stop this behaviour and use only disk-based Caching, set `options(reproducible.useMemoise = FALSE)` .
* Cache assign -- `%<%` can be used instead of normal assign, equivalent to `lhs <- Cache(rhs)`.
* new option: reproducible.verbose, set to FALSE by default, but if set to true may help understand caching behaviour, especially for complex highly nested code.
* all options now described in `?reproducible`.
* All Cache arguments other than FUN and ... will now propagate to internal, nested Cache calls, if they are not specified explicitly in each of the inner Cache calls. 
* Cached pipe operator `%C%` -- use to begin a pipe sequence, e.g., `Cache() %C% ...`
* Cache arg `sideEffect` can now be a path
* Cache arg `digestPathContent` default changed from FALSE (was for speed) to TRUE (for content accuracy)
* New function, `searchFull`, which shows the full search path, known alternatively as "scope", or "binding environments". It is where R will search for a function when requested by a user.
* Uses `memoise::memoise` for several functions (`loadFromLocalRepo`, `pkgDep`, `package_dependencies`, `available.packages`) for speed -- will impact memory at the expense of speed.
* New `Require` function 

    - attempts to create a lighter weight package reproducibility chain. This function is usable in a reproducible workflow: it includes both installing and loading of packages, it can maintain version numbers, and uses smart caching for speed. In tests, it can evaluate whether 20 packages and their dependencies (~130 packages) are installed and loaded quickly (i.e., if all TRUE,  ~0.1 seconds). This is much slower than running `require` on those 20 packages, but `require` does not check for dependencies and deal with them if missing: it just errors. This speed should be fast enough for many purposes.
    - can accept uncommented name, if length 1.
    
* remove `dplyr` from Imports
* Add `RCurl` to Imports
* change name of `digestRaster` to `.digestRaster`

version 0.1.3
=============

* fix R CMD check errors on Solaris that were not previously resolved

version 0.1.2
=============

* fix R CMD check errors on Solaris
* fix bug in `digestRaster` affecting in-memory rasters
* move `rgdal` to Suggests

version 0.1.1
=============

* cleanup examples and *do* run them (per CRAN)
* add tests to ensure all exported (non-dot) functions have examples

version 0.1.0
=============

* A new package, which takes all caching utilities out of the `SpaDES` package.
