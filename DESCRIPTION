Title: Enhance Reproducibility of R Code
Description: A collection of high-level, machine- and OS-independent tools
    for making reproducible and reusable content in R.
    The two workhorse functions are Cache() and prepInputs(). Cache()
    allows for nested caching, is robust to environments and objects with
    environments (like functions), and has deals with some classes of 
    file-backed R objects e.g., from terra and raster packages. 
    Both functions have been developed to 
    be foundational components of data retrieval
    and processing in continuous workflow situations. In both functions,
    efforts are made to make the first and subsequent calls of functions have 
    the same result, but faster at subsequent times by way of checksums
    and digesting. Several features are still under development, including
    cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for sharing between users. Several
    advanced options are available, see ?reproducibleOptions().
SystemRequirements: 'unrar' (Linux/macOS) or '7-Zip' (Windows) to work with '.rar' files.
