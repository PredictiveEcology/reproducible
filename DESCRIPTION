Title: A Set of Tools that Enhance Reproducibility Beyond Package Management
Description: Collection of high-level, machine- and OS-independent tools
    for making deeply reproducible and reusable content in R.
    The two workhorse functions are 'Cache()' and 'prepInputs()'; 
    these allow for: nested caching, robust to environments, and objects with
    environments (like functions); and data retrieval and processing 
    in continuous workflow environments. In all cases,
    efforts are made to make the first and subsequent calls of functions have 
    the same result, but vastly faster at subsequent times by way of checksums
    and digesting. Several features are still under development, including
    cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for sharing between users. Several
    advanced options are available, see '?reproducibleOptions()'.
SystemRequirements: 'unrar' (Linux/macOS) or '7-Zip' (Windows) to work with '.rar' files.
